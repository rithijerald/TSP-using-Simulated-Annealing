# TSP-using-Simulated-Annealing
The project is to parallelize the simulated annealing al- gorithm. It is a metaheuristic algorithm that can be used to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. For problems like TSP, addition of new cities will result in a combinatorial explosion in the number of routes to be traversed. This will result in a considerable increase in the amount of time it takes to find the optimal solution. This is when metaheuristic algorithms come into action. The Simulated Annealing algorithm resembles the annealing process that is used in metallurgy. In metallurgy, the atoms move fast when the system is in high temperature. When the temperature is reduced, the kinetic energy decreases and the system gets more easy to work with. Similarly in Simulated Annealing algorithm, the process starts with a high randomness and gradually lowers its temperature until it reaches an optimal solution. Simulated Annealing algorithm has the capacity to escape from local minima and converge to global maximum.
